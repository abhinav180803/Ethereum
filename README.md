# Explaination

1. *SPDX-License-Identifier:* This is a comment that indicates the license under which the contract code is released. In this case, it's using the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license.

2. *Pragma Directive:* The line `pragma solidity 0.8.18;` specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used for compiling this contract. The version 0.8.18 is relatively high, so make sure that your compiler supports it.

3. *Contract Definition:* The contract is defined as `contract Abhinav { ... }`. The name of the contract is "Abhinav."

4. *Public Variables:*
   - `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol`: These are two public string variables representing the name and symbol of the token, respectively. In this case, the token is named "Abhinav," and its symbol is "UID."
   - `totalSupply`: This is a public unsigned integer variable that keeps track of the total supply of the tokens. Initially, it's set to 0.

5. *Mapping Variable:*
   - `balances`: This is a mapping that associates addresses (of users) with their token balances. The keys are addresses, and the values are unsigned integers representing the corresponding token balances.

6. *Mint Function (`mintTokens`):*
   - This function is used to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specific address.
   - `address _address`: The address to which the new tokens will be assigned.
   - `uint _amount`: The number of tokens to be minted and assigned.
   - The function increments the `totalSupply` by `_amount` and increases the balance of the `_address` by `_amount`.

7. *Burn Function (`burnTokens`):*
   - This function is used to burn (destroy) tokens by reducing the total supply and the balance of a specific address.
   - `address _address`: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
   - `uint _amount`: The number of tokens to be burned.
   - The function checks if the balance of the `_address` is sufficient to burn the requested `_amount` and then decreases the `totalSupply` and the `_address` balance by `_amount`.

8. *Function Modifiers:* The absence of function modifiers in this contract means that the functions are accessible by anyone and do not have any access restrictions.

# Code
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;


contract Abhinav {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Abhinav";
    string public tokenSymbol = "UID";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balances[_address] += _amount;
    }

    // burn function
    function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _amount, "Cannot burn more than balance tokens");
        totalSupply -= _amount;
        balances[_address] -= _amount;
    }
}

# Execution

1. **Contract Deployment:**
   - The contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain by a user through a transaction.
   - The contract's code is stored on the blockchain, and a contract address is generated.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The contract's `tokenName`, `tokenSymbol`, and `totalSupply` are initialized.
   - The `balances` mapping is created to store token balances for different addresses.

3. **Mint Function Execution (`mintTokens`):
   - A user calls the `mintTokens` function, providing the `_address` and `_amount` as arguments.
   - The function executes the following steps:
     - It increments the `totalSupply` by `_amount`, effectively increasing the total token supply.
     - It adds `_amount` tokens to the `_address`'s balance in the `balances` mapping.

4. **Burn Function Execution (`burnTokens`):
   - A user calls the `burnTokens` function, providing the `_address` and `_amount` as arguments.
   - The function executes the following steps:
     - It checks whether the `_address` has a balance greater than or equal to `_amount`.
     - If the balance is sufficient, it deducts `_amount` tokens from the `_address`'s balance in the `balances` mapping.
     - It decreases the `totalSupply` by `_amount`, effectively reducing the total token supply.

5. **Transaction Verification:**
   - The Ethereum network verifies the transaction's validity.
   - The network checks for sufficient gas, sender's authorization, and adherence to contract logic.

6. **State Update:**
   - If the transaction is valid, the contract's state is updated:
     - Changes to `totalSupply` and `balances` are reflected based on the executed minting or burning actions.
   - If the transaction fails, the state remains unchanged.

7. **Gas Consumption:**
   - Gas is consumed for every operation in the contract, including reading and writing data, executing functions, and more.
   - Users pay gas fees to miners to cover the computational resources used by their transactions.

8. **Public Variable Access:**
   - The contract's `tokenName`, `tokenSymbol`, `totalSupply`, and other public variables can be accessed by anyone without executing a transaction.

9. **View and Pure Functions:**
   - If the contract contained functions marked as `view` or `pure`, these functions could be called without requiring a transaction. They only retrieve data and do not modify the state.

10. **Smart Contract Interaction:**
    - Other contracts or external applications can interact with this contract by calling its functions and reading its public variables.
  
11. **Event Logging (Not Present in the Provided Code):**
    - Typically, Solidity contracts emit events to log important state changes or interactions. Events are used to provide a way for external applications to listen and react to changes on the blockchain.

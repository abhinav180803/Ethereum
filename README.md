# Explaination

1. *SPDX-License-Identifier:* This is a comment that indicates the license under which the contract code is released. In this case, it's using the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license.

2. *Pragma Directive:* The line `pragma solidity 0.8.18;` specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used for compiling this contract. The version 0.8.18 is relatively high, so make sure that your compiler supports it.

3. *Contract Definition:* The contract is defined as `contract Abhinav { ... }`. The name of the contract is "Abhinav."

4. *Public Variables:*
   - `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol`: These are two public string variables representing the name and symbol of the token, respectively. In this case, the token is named "Abhinav," and its symbol is "UID."
   - `totalSupply`: This is a public unsigned integer variable that keeps track of the total supply of the tokens. Initially, it's set to 0.

5. *Mapping Variable:*
   - `balances`: This is a mapping that associates addresses (of users) with their token balances. The keys are addresses, and the values are unsigned integers representing the corresponding token balances.

6. *Mint Function (`mintTokens`):*
   - This function is used to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specific address.
   - `address _address`: The address to which the new tokens will be assigned.
   - `uint _amount`: The number of tokens to be minted and assigned.
   - The function increments the `totalSupply` by `_amount` and increases the balance of the `_address` by `_amount`.

7. *Burn Function (`burnTokens`):*
   - This function is used to burn (destroy) tokens by reducing the total supply and the balance of a specific address.
   - `address _address`: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
   - `uint _amount`: The number of tokens to be burned.
   - The function checks if the balance of the `_address` is sufficient to burn the requested `_amount` and then decreases the `totalSupply` and the `_address` balance by `_amount`.

8. *Function Modifiers:* The absence of function modifiers in this contract means that the functions are accessible by anyone and do not have any access restrictions.
